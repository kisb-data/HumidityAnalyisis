# Humidity Analysis

## About the Project

I created the project in order to be able to measure and better understand the processes taking place in the structure of a wooden house in terms of the moisture in the air. 
If you are thinking in terms of similar measurements or want to work from published data, you will find a solution for data conversion and evaluation.
